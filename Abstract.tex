This article will highlight the specific issues that can arise in relation to a dynamic screen resolution, as well as different ways of handling them.

When a game is required to be played on several screen resolutions, issues can arise, due to the fact that the gameworld will be represented differently. When a game is scaled to a different resolution, it can cause the graphics to produce poor results, which makes it important for the developers to take scaling into consideration when creating the game. Different resolutions can also cause a difference in gameplay, when the aspect ratio is changed, making it even more important to find the optimal way of solving the issues.
